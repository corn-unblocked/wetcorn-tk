		<p>Hello! You probably don't know me. I'll try to keep it that way, but you could probably find my name pretty easily if you tried. I created this site because I believe the internet should be free. If you don't share my opinion, please don't try to hinder my progress. The internet is far to powerful for that.<br>
		Whoever you are, thank you for visiting my site! Even if you don't approve of my motives, your acknowledgement of my presence is a reward in itself.<br>
		Find me on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/zeroxoneafour">here</a> if you have an problem with <a href="https://github.com/zeroxoneafour/corn">the site</a>.
